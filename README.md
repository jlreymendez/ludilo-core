# Ludilo - Core

Ludilo is a library of common unity components and assets I am building to make my game development more modular, data oriented and in the end faster and less error prone.

This is the core part of this library which was greatly based on Ryan Hipple [Unite 2017](https://github.com/roboryantron/Unite2017) talk and examples. Mostly based on using scriptable objects for removing the use of Singletons in my projects.

## Features

* Generic and commonly used scriptable object variables and references.
  * Custom editor for references.
* Generic scriptable object events. With and without parameters.
* Generic and game object runtime list.
